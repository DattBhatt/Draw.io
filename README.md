# 📂 Draw.io File Storage  



This repository is used to **save and store diagrams created with [draw.io / diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/)** in a clean and organized format. It acts as a central place to keep versions of diagrams for documentation, workflows, and visual designs.  



---



## 🚀 Features  

- Stores `.drawio` files in version control.  
- Ensures diagrams are saved in a **readable, editable, and trackable format**.  
- Easy to export diagrams into **PNG, SVG, or PDF** when needed.  
- Keeps project documentation **visual and structured**.

- **`/diagrams/`** → contains the original `.drawio` source files.  

- **`/exports/`** → optional directory for exported formats (PNG/SVG/PDF).

## 🛠 How to Use  



1. Open any `.drawio` file using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) (online) or the desktop app.  

2. Edit or update the diagram.  

3. Save and commit the changes.  

4. (Optional) Export to PNG/SVG/PDF and save in the `exports/` folder.  



---



## ✅ Best Practices  

- Always commit `.drawio` files to keep diagrams editable.  

- If exporting diagrams, keep exports **separate from source files**.  

- Use meaningful filenames (e.g., `system-architecture.drawio`, `workflow-v2.drawio`).
